# Hi, I'm Andy Woods üëã

**Director of Product Management at Cockroach Labs** | Building at the intersection of distributed systems and AI

I lead product strategy for CockroachDB's application ecosystem integrations, pricing, and AI initiatives. Over the past decade, I've scaled CockroachDB from pre-revenue to $100M+ ARR and category leadership, while maintaining hands-on technical skills through building production AI systems and analyzing thousands of product signals monthly. I'm passionate about making complex technology accessible to developers, whether it's distributed systems or generative AI.

## üíº Background

I'm a product leader who stays technical and in the details. With 10+ years in product development and an MBA from Kellogg, I bridge the gap between technical complexity and business impact. My background spans distributed infrastructure, cloud service provider integrations, and AI/ML systems. I analyze product signals using SQL and Python, build prototypes to validate ideas, and evaluate strategic partnerships.
