**Director of Product Management at Cockroach Labs** | Building at the intersection of distributed systems and AI

I lead product strategy for CockroachDB's application ecosystem integrations, pricing, and AI initiatives. Over the past decade, I've scaled CockroachDB from pre-revenue to $100M+ ARR and category leadership, while maintaining hands-on technical skills through building production AI systems and analyzing thousands of product signals monthly. I'm passionate about making complex technology accessible to developers, whether it's distributed systems or generative AI.
